# Codebook for run_analysis project

Data was obtained from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Additional information on the data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# Coding and Transformation
A copy of the script utilized for analysis is in: run_analysis.R
Data was loaded, test and training data was merged and labelled, and a smaller dataset was created which abstracted only the mean and standard deviation variables.

Data will output to the ./UCI HAR Dataset/tidy_data.txt
