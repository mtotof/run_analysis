# Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The project requires: 1) a tidy data set, 2) a link to a Github repository with utilized script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

Data was collected from accelerometers on Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. The full description on the data is available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
